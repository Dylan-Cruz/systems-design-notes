# I'm preparing notes about the systems design interview process. What is essential to know

Preparing for a systems design interview requires a blend of technical depth, structured problem-solving, and strong communication. Here’s what is essential to know, organized for effective note-taking and interview preparation:

## Key Concepts and Building Blocks

Familiarize yourself with the foundational components and patterns that recur in system design interviews:

- **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic across servers to ensure reliability and scalability.
- **Caching**: Improves performance and reduces load by storing frequently accessed data.
- **Partitioning (Sharding)**: Splits data across multiple machines for scalability and fault tolerance.
- **Replication**: Duplicates data across systems for high availability and disaster recovery.
- **Databases**: Know when to use SQL vs. NoSQL, and understand consistency, indexing, and transactions.
- **Proxies (Forward/Reverse)**: Manage traffic and security between clients and servers.
- **API Gateways and RESTful API Design**: Centralize request routing, authentication, and aggregation.
- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**: Distribute content closer to users for lower latency.
- **Distributed Messaging (Queues, Pub/Sub)**: Decouple services and handle asynchronous processing.
- **System Monitoring and Metrics**: Track health, performance, and errors.

## Interview Structure and Approach

Most system design interviews follow a similar structure. Use a consistent framework to ensure you cover all critical aspects:

| Step                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Clarify Requirements                            | Ask about both functional and non-functional requirements (FRs and NFRs), such as scalability, latency, consistency, and security. Confirm user flows and constraints.                   |
| 2. Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation                 | Estimate scale: users, requests per second, data volume, and growth projections. This informs your architectural choices.                                                                |
| 3. Define System Interfaces                        | Outline APIs and user interaction points. Ensure the design supports all required operations.                                                                                            |
| 4. High-Level Design                               | Sketch the main components: clients, load balancers, services, databases, caches, etc. Show data flow and interactions.                                                                  |
| 5. Deep Dive on Components                         | Select 2–3 critical components (e.g., database, caching, messaging) and discuss them in detail, including trade-offs.                                                                    |
| 6. Address Bottlenecks, Trade-offs, and Edge Cases | Identify potential failure points, discuss mitigation strategies, and justify your design decisions. Consider scalability, availability, and consistency trade-offs (e.g., CAP theorem). |
| 7. Summarize and Review                            | Recap your design, highlight strengths, and address any remaining questions or hypothetical changes from the interviewer.                                                                |

## Essential Topics to Review

- **Networking Basics**: Protocols, web servers, DNS, proxies.
- **Scaling Techniques**: Horizontal vs. vertical scaling, partitioning, replication.
- **Performance Metrics**: Throughput, latency, availability, service-level agreements.
- **Data Storage**: Key-value stores, relational/NoSQL databases, distributed file systems.
- **Caching Strategies**: LRU, write-through, write-back, consistent hashing.
- **Concurrency and Synchronization**: Mutexes, semaphores, deadlocks (for some companies).
- **Design Patterns**: Singleton, factory, observer, strategy, etc.
- **Security and Privacy**: Authentication, authorization, encryption basics.
- **Case Studies**: Practice designing systems like URL shorteners, chat apps, news feeds, and recommendation engines.

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Communicate Clearly**: Explain your reasoning, ask clarifying questions, and justify every major decision.
- **Practice Mock Interviews**: Simulate real interview conditions and seek feedback to refine your approach.
- **Be Adaptable**: Respond to interviewer feedback and hypothetical changes; demonstrate flexibility in your design thinking.
- **Time Management**: Allocate time to each step; don’t get bogged down in low-level details too early.
- **Use Diagrams**: Visual aids help structure your thoughts and communicate architecture effectively.
- **Start Simple, Iterate**: Begin with a basic design, then add complexity as needed or as prompted by the interviewer.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Failing to clarify requirements before diving into the design.
- Ignoring non-functional requirements (e.g., latency, availability).
- Not discussing trade-offs or justifying technology choices.
- Neglecting to address scaling, bottlenecks, or failure scenarios.
- Poor communication—thinking silently instead of sharing your process.

**In summary:**
Success in system design interviews hinges on mastering core concepts, using a structured approach, communicating effectively, and practicing real-world scenarios. Focus on understanding the big picture, justifying your decisions, and demonstrating adaptability under changing requirements.
