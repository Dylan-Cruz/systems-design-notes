## Polling, Long Polling, WebSockets, and Webhooks: System Design Notes

These four mechanisms are fundamental for real-time data delivery and event-driven architectures, commonly discussed in system design interviews. Understanding their differences, trade-offs, and best-fit scenarios is essential.

### **Polling**

- **Definition**: The client repeatedly sends requests to the server at fixed intervals (e.g., every few seconds) to check for new data or updates.
- **How it Works**:
    - Client initiates a request to the server.
    - Server processes and responds (with data or empty response).
    - Client waits for the next interval, then repeats the process.
- **Pros**:
    - Simple to implement.
    - Works everywhere HTTP is supported.
- **Cons**:
    - Inefficient: Many requests return no new data, wasting bandwidth and increasing server load.
    - Higher latency: Updates are only as fast as the polling interval.
- **Use Cases**:
    - Low-frequency updates where real-time is not critical.
    - Environments where more advanced protocols are not supported.

### **Long Polling**

- **Definition**: An enhancement over basic polling. The client sends a request, and the server holds the connection open until new data is available or a timeout occurs.
- **How it Works**:
    - Client sends a request.
    - Server waits (holds the request open) until there is new data or timeout.
    - When data is available, server responds and closes the connection.
    - Client immediately sends a new request, repeating the process.
- **Pros**:
    - Reduces unnecessary requests, lowering bandwidth and server load compared to basic polling.
    - Provides near real-time updates without requiring persistent connections.
    - Simple to implement using standard HTTP.
- **Cons**:
    - Still requires frequent connection re-establishment, which can be costly at scale.
    - Server must manage many open connections, which can exhaust resources under heavy load.
    - Not ideal for high-frequency updates or large data volumes.
- **Use Cases**:
    - Chat apps, notifications, live feeds with moderate update frequency.
    - Scenarios where WebSockets are not available or feasible.

### **WebSockets**

- **Definition**: A protocol providing full-duplex, bidirectional communication over a single, persistent TCP connection.
- **How it Works**:
    - Client and server perform a handshake to establish a WebSocket connection.
    - Both can send messages to each other at any time until the connection is closed.
- **Pros**:
    - Real-time, low-latency communication.
    - Efficient: Single persistent connection reduces overhead.
    - Bidirectional: Both client and server can initiate communication.
    - Scales well with optimized infrastructure; suitable for high-frequency, interactive use cases.
- **Cons**:
    - More complex to implement and deploy (requires WebSocket support on both client and server).
    - Persistent connections can increase server resource usage.
    - Not all older browsers or proxies support WebSockets.
- **Use Cases**:
    - Real-time chat, collaborative editing, live dashboards, gaming, IoT.

### **Webhooks**

- **Definition**: Event-driven HTTP callbacks that allow one system to notify another when a specific event occurs.
- **How it Works**:
    - System A registers a webhook endpoint with System B.
    - When an event happens in System B, it sends an HTTP POST (or similar) to System A’s endpoint with event data.
    - No polling required; updates are pushed as events happen.
- **Pros**:
    - Real-time notifications without polling.
    - Efficient: Data sent only when events occur, reducing server load and bandwidth.
    - Decouples systems, enabling automation and integration.
- **Cons**:
    - Security: Endpoints must be secured to prevent abuse.
    - Reliability: If the receiver is down, events may be lost unless retries or queuing are implemented.
    - One-way: Receiver cannot request updates on demand; must rely on sender’s event triggers.
- **Use Cases**:
    - Payment notifications (e.g., Stripe, PayPal), CI/CD integrations (e.g., GitHub), order/shipment updates, workflow automation.

| Feature | Polling | Long Polling | WebSockets | Webhooks |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Communication | Client-initiated | Client-initiated | Bidirectional | Server-initiated |
| Connection | Repeated HTTP | Repeated HTTP | Persistent TCP | HTTP callback |

| Server Load | High | Moderate-High | Low (if optimized) | Low |
| Complexity | Simple | Moderate | Complex | Moderate |
| Use Cases | Legacy, simple | Moderate real-time | High-frequency RT | System integration |
| Reliability | High | Moderate | High | Depends on retries |

### **When to Use Each Approach**

- **Polling**: Simple, legacy systems, or when real-time is not required.
- **Long Polling**: When you need near real-time updates but can’t use WebSockets.
- **WebSockets**: For true real-time, bidirectional, high-frequency communication.
- **Webhooks**: For integrating systems and triggering actions on events, especially across organizational boundaries.

### **Key Interview Insights**

- Always discuss trade-offs: simplicity vs. efficiency, scalability, and infrastructure requirements.
- Consider fallback strategies (e.g., polling as backup for webhooks).
- Address security, reliability, and error handling (especially for webhooks and persistent connections).
- Choose the right tool based on update frequency, latency requirements, and infrastructure constraints.
