## Strong Consistency vs. Eventual Consistency: System Design Interview Notes

**Understanding the trade-offs between strong and eventual consistency is fundamental for distributed systems design, especially in interview scenarios. Below is a concise, structured comparison, with definitions, use cases, pros and cons, and key considerations.**

---

### **Definitions**

- **Strong Consistency**
    - Guarantees that all users see the most recent, up-to-date version of the data at the same time, immediately after a write is confirmed.
    - Every read returns the latest write, regardless of which node is accessed.
    - Achieved through synchronization mechanisms (e.g., consensus algorithms like Paxos, Raft, or protocols like two-phase commit).
- **Eventual Consistency**
    - Guarantees that, given enough time without new updates, all replicas will converge to the same value.
    - Reads may return stale or outdated data for a period, but all nodes will eventually reflect the latest state.
    - Updates are propagated asynchronously across replicas.

### **Comparison Table**

| Feature | Strong Consistency | Eventual Consistency |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Data Visibility | Immediate, always up-to-date |
| User Experience | Predictable, no surprises for users |
| Performance | Higher latency, lower throughput |
| Availability | Can be reduced during network partitions |
| Scalability | Harder to scale due to coordination needs |
| Use Cases | Banking, critical transactions, inventory |
| Implementation | Consensus protocols, synchronous replication |
| Consistency Guarantee | Always consistent | Eventually consistent |

### **Pros and Cons**

**Strong Consistency**

- **Pros:**
    - Ensures data integrity and correctness at all times.
    - Simplifies application logic; developers can assume latest data.
- **Cons:**
    - Higher latency due to coordination overhead.
    - Lower availability, especially during network partitions (CAP theorem).
    - Harder to scale across distributed regions.

**Eventual Consistency**

- **Pros:**
    - High availability and partition tolerance.
    - Low latency and high throughput, suitable for global-scale systems.
    - Scalable and resilient to network failures.
- **Cons:**
    - Data may be temporarily inconsistent; users may see outdated information.
    - Application logic must handle inconsistencies and potential conflicts.
    - Risk of data loss if a replica fails before update propagation.

### **When to Use Each Model**

- **Strong Consistency:**
    - Required when absolute correctness is critical (e.g., financial transactions, inventory management, account balances).
    - Suitable for systems where stale or conflicting data cannot be tolerated.
- **Eventual Consistency:**
    - Ideal for systems prioritizing availability and scalability over immediate consistency (e.g., social media feeds, product catalogs, distributed caches).
    - Acceptable when temporary inconsistency does not impact core business logic or user experience.

### **Key Interview Talking Points**

- **CAP Theorem**: In distributed systems, you must often choose between Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance. Strong consistency sacrifices availability, while eventual consistency sacrifices immediate consistency for availability and partition tolerance.
- **Real-World Examples**:
    - Strong Consistency: Banking systems, stock trading platforms.
    - Eventual Consistency: Amazon DynamoDB, social networks, DNS, caches.
- **Implementation Strategies**:
    - Strong: Synchronous replication, distributed transactions, consensus protocols.
    - Eventual: Asynchronous replication, background reconciliation, conflict resolution (e.g., last-write-wins, vector clocks).
- **Design Trade-offs**: Always justify your choice of consistency model based on use case requirements for data integrity, latency, availability, and scalability.

---

### **Summary**

- **Strong consistency** ensures immediate data correctness but at the cost of performance and scalability.
- **Eventual consistency** enables high availability and scalability but tolerates temporary inconsistency.
- The choice depends on application requirements, user expectations, and system constraints.

> Striking the right balance is the key to designing a robust and efficient system, ensuring both data correctness and a seamless user experience.
