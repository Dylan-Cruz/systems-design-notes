# Prepare notes on Rest v RPC essential to the systems design interview process

Here are concise, interview-focused notes on REST vs RPC essential for systems design interviews:

## REST vs RPC: Essential Comparison for Systems Design Interviews


---

### 1. **Architectural Style and Focus**

- **REST (Representational State Transfer)**
    - Resource-oriented architecture.
    - Interacts with resources identified by URIs.
    - Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for CRUD operations.
    - Stateless: Each request contains all info needed; server does not maintain client state.
    - Emphasizes uniform interface and resource representation (JSON, XML).
- **RPC (Remote Procedure Call)**
    - Action-oriented architecture.
    - Focuses on executing specific functions or procedures remotely.
    - Can use multiple protocols (HTTP, TCP, etc.).
    - Can be stateless or stateful depending on implementation.
    - Client calls remote methods as if local, passing parameters; server executes and returns results.

---

### 2. **Communication and Protocol**

| Aspect | REST | RPC |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Protocol | Primarily HTTP | HTTP, TCP, or other protocols |
| Methods/Verbs | Standard HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) | Usually GET and POST; method calls |
| Data Format | Flexible (JSON, XML, etc.) | Often specific formats (XML-RPC, JSON-RPC, gRPC uses Protobuf) |
| Statelessness | Always stateless | Can be stateless or stateful |
| Interface | Uniform interface with resource URIs | Interface Definition Language (IDL) defines methods |


---

### 3. **Design Principles**

- **REST:**
    - Statelessness: Server does not store client context.
    - Client-server separation.
    - Uniform interface simplifies interaction.
    - Cacheability to improve performance.
    - Layered system architecture for scalability and security.
- **RPC:**
    - Remote invocation of procedures.
    - Uses stubs and skeletons generated from interface definitions.
    - May maintain session or state on server.
    - Requires interface specifications (IDL) for client-server contract.
    - Often used for tightly coupled, internal services needing low latency.

---

### 4. **Use Cases**

- **REST:**
    - Public-facing APIs.
    - Applications requiring scalability, caching, and loose coupling.
    - CRUD operations on resources (e.g., user profiles, products, orders).
    - Web services where standard HTTP semantics are beneficial.
- **RPC:**
    - Internal microservices communication.
    - Action-oriented operations like payment processing, inventory updates.
    - Performance-critical, low-latency scenarios.
    - When you need to invoke specific procedures rather than manipulate resources.

---

### 5. **Advantages and Disadvantages**

| Aspect | REST Advantages | REST Disadvantages | RPC Advantages | RPC Disadvantages |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Simplicity | Uses standard HTTP verbs, easy to understand | Can cause over-fetching or under-fetching | Straightforward function calls | Can be complex due to interface definitions |
| Scalability | Statelessness improves scalability | Lack of strict standardization | Efficient for tightly coupled systems | Less flexible, often tightly coupled |
| Performance | Leverages HTTP caching | May require multiple calls for complex operations | Low latency, efficient communication | May maintain state, reducing scalability |
| Flexibility | Supports multiple data formats | Limited to CRUD operations | Supports various protocols | Less suited for public APIs |


---

### 6. **Example**

- **REST Example:**
Managing products in an e-commerce app via endpoints like `/products` using GET to fetch, POST to create, PUT to update, DELETE to remove products.
- **RPC Example:**
Internal payment service exposing a method `ProcessPayment(amount, accountId)` invoked remotely by clients to perform payment transactions.

---

### 7. **Summary**

| Feature | REST | RPC |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Orientation | Resource-based | Action-based |
| Protocol | HTTP | HTTP, TCP, others |
| State | Stateless | Stateful or stateless |
| Interface | Uniform interface, URIs | Interface Definition Language (IDL) |
| Use Case | Public APIs, CRUD operations | Internal services, commands |
| Scalability | High | Moderate |
| Complexity | Lower | Higher due to interface specs |
