# Estimations

Rough estimations to help you assess the feasibility and performance of a proposed solution and to identify any potential bottlenecks

## Steps

1. **Rule of Thumb** - Baselines founded in experience: ex.) estimation a user will generate 1mb of data per day on a social media platform
2. **Breakdown and Aggregation** - Break the problem down into smaller estimations and aggregate them for total system requirements. ex.) estimate storage needs for user profile data and for multimedia content
3. **Sanity Check** - Are the estimates reasonable? Compare with a real source

## Types

- **Load Estimation**: requests per second, data volume, user traffic
- **Storage Estimation**: how much storage to house data generated by the system
- **Bandwidth Estimation**: network bandwidth needed
- **Latency Estimation**: response time of the system
- **Resource Estimation**: number of cpus, servers, memory required
