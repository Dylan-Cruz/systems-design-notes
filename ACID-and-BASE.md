## ACID and BASE: Essential Notes for Systems Design Interviews

Understanding ACID and BASE is crucial for systems design interviews, especially when discussing database choices, data consistency, and system scalability. Below are concise, interview-ready notes covering definitions, trade-offs, and practical implications.

## **ACID Properties**

ACID defines the core guarantees for reliable transaction processing in traditional relational databases:

- **Atomicity**: Each transaction is treated as a single "all or nothing" unit. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, ensuring the database is never left in a partial or inconsistent state.
- **Consistency**: Transactions transition the database from one valid state to another, always enforcing all predefined rules, constraints, and triggers. This ensures no transaction can violate data integrity.
- **Isolation**: Transactions are isolated from each other, appearing to execute serially even when processed concurrently. This prevents issues like dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.
- **Durability**: Once a transaction is committed, its results are permanentâ€”even in the event of power loss, crashes, or errors. The data survives system failures.

**Example:**
Transferring money between two bank accounts: both the debit and credit must succeed together, or neither happens. If a failure occurs mid-transaction, all changes are undone.

## **BASE Properties**

BASE is an alternative model, often used in distributed NoSQL systems, which relaxes some ACID guarantees for better scalability and availability:

- **Basically Available**: The system guarantees availability, even if some data is inconsistent or stale.
- **Soft state**: The state of the system may change over time, even without input, due to eventual consistency and replication delays.
- **Eventually Consistent**: The system does not guarantee immediate consistency after updates, but ensures that, given enough time, all replicas will converge to the same state.

**Key Difference:**
BASE prioritizes availability and partition tolerance over strict consistency, making it suitable for large-scale, distributed environments where immediate consistency is less critical.

## **ACID vs. BASE: Comparison Table**

| Property     | ACID (Relational DBs)                | BASE (NoSQL/Distributed DBs)       |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| Consistency  | Strict, immediate                    | Eventual, may be temporarily stale |
| Availability | May be reduced during failures       | High, even during network issues   |
| Isolation    | Strong (serializable)                | Weaker, often relaxed              |
| Durability   | Guaranteed                           | Often eventual, may risk some loss |
| Use Case     | Banking, critical data, transactions | Social media, caching, analytics   |

## **Trade-offs and Design Considerations**

- **Performance vs. Consistency**: ACID ensures strong consistency but can introduce latency and reduce throughput, especially in distributed systems.
- **Scalability**: ACID properties, particularly isolation and atomicity, make horizontal scaling complex. BASE models are designed to scale out more easily.
- **Tunable Models**: Some modern databases (NewSQL) offer tunable consistency, allowing developers to balance between ACID and BASE depending on requirements.
- **CAP Theorem**: In distributed systems, you can only guarantee two of Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance. ACID leans toward Consistency, BASE toward Availability and Partition tolerance.

## **When to Use ACID vs. BASE**

- **ACID**:
  - Financial systems, order processing, inventory management
  - Any scenario where data integrity and correctness are paramount
- **BASE**:
  - Social networks, real-time analytics, caching layers
  - Systems where high availability and partition tolerance are more important than immediate consistency

## **Summary for Interviews**

- Clearly define ACID and BASE, and explain their trade-offs.
- Relate your choice to system requirements: prioritize ACID for correctness, BASE for scalability and availability.
- Reference the CAP theorem when discussing distributed systems.
- Highlight the trend toward tunable consistency in modern databases to balance these models.

These notes will help you confidently discuss data consistency models and make informed design decisions in systems design interviews.
